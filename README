This program implements the Naive Bayes Classification system. 
The program runs in the command prompt. 
This code assumes all data being trained are in the same folder system as the java code. 
The user will be able to train data, classify data, test accuracy, and exit out of the program.
Before running make sure to have car.test, car.meta, and car.train or your own data files in the proper format in the same folder. 

Compile code:
	javac Main.java
Run code:
	java Main

When code is first ran, it will ask for two files train the data.  
	Enter files as in format as: meta,train
The user then can train, classify, test accuracy, and exit in any order.
In order to classify give an input and output file.
	Example: input,output
In order to test accuracy, give an input file.
In order to exit, just hit exit when not doing one of the other commands.



Creating own files to train:
	The files given are just sample files. Here are the rules to create new files in order to create more data files train.
	Meta File:
		The meta file must have the name of the attribute, followed by a : then the values. 
		Each additional value must be separated by a , only.  
		Each attribute is put on separate lines.
		The last attribute is the classification.
		Note there is no spaces between each value.
		
		Syntax: attribute:value,value,value

		Example:
			tires:2,4
			type:bike,car
	
	Train/classify files:
		The file being trained and classified is in the same format.
		For each attribute, there needs to be a value. Each line represents one data. 
		Syntax with 5 attributes: value,value,value,value,value

		Example using Meta File example:
			2,bike
			4,car
			2,car
